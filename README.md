I wanted to track which cards I have, according to whether they're in the Ho-Oh or Lugia packs or if they're nonexclusive to either, so that I can better decide which pack to open.

This allows me to tally which of the *, **, *** cards I have and will report my progress towards completing the packs. I've also integrated it with my home server to remotely save/restore my progress.
